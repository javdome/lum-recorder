## Install and run 

### With Node
The app is made through Electron-forge, so you can install and run it with the following commands:

``` javascript
npm install

npm start
```

### Build
You can create a build (executable without npm).

Create a distributable:

``` javascript
npm run make
```

Electron-forge creates the out folder where your package will be located.

If your OS is Windows you can download the executable from the [Release section](https://github.com/javdome/lum-recorder/releases) to install the application.

> During the installation, probably you will see a security alert.
> That is normal, since I have not paid any certifiation for the distribuion.
> So, press "More info" and continue with the installation.
